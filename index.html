											<h3>Relationship Building</h3>

										<p>Working hybrid means my dog is the coworker I see the most. He is quiet, lets me work, and reminds me to get up and walk occasionally.
											Getting to know people, understanding their perspectives, and what is important to them is one of my best strengths. 
											Afterall, we are all working toward the same goal and want what is best for the company.

											<h3>Dealing with Ambiguity </h3>
										</header>
										<p>This might be my best strength. Is the guidance unclear, vague, and contradictory? Maybe even impossible? I 
											am the person for the job. I love diving into these scenarios, figuring out what is actually needed, and communicating clear guidance as a result.
											This is also why I quickly become a go-to person on processes and software.

											<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
										</header>
										<p> This comes after figuring out the ambiguity. Once you know what is needed, you often are faced with the how. This might be working through a 
											technical issue with subject matter experts, resolving personel issues, or conflicts between teams with different goals. No matter what the problem is
											I am always happy to dive in to help with the solution.

												<h2>What I lack in <strong>software experience </strong>...<br />
												I make up for in ambition</h2>
											</header>
											<a  class="image featured"><img src="images/train.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Where am I Going?</h3>
											<p>I am over a decade into my career and looking to move into the software industry. When you are 18 years old and you pick your career, you really don't know what you want. I love managing relationships with people 
												and departments, technical projects, programs, whatever it might be. What I manage might change, but the foundation is always the same. So I am looking to take those skills somewhere that
												better aligns with my interests. 
												Early in my career I made several VBA macro's for large groups of people. Quickly you learn that people do not use Excel exactly the way you do. In fact, some do things in a really weird way.
												I might be able to get Excel to do anything short of changing the physical world, but I may never fully know how to people proof it so it never breaks. 
												
												I also make amateur android apps, and those obstacles are more around how people know what to do without you having to explain it. I have a lot to learn, but I also have a deep appreciation
												for the field. It is not easy, and it is certainly not kind. 

												I am looking to combine my love and interest in software development, with my skills as a project manager. I am a quick learner, and excited for my next opportunity.

												<h2>Career Highlights</h2>
											</header>
											<a  class="image featured"><img src="images/citationlatitudethin.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Engineering Project Coordination</h3>
											<p>Coordinated engineering activities to get FAA certification as efficiently as possible. 
												In this role, I identified needs and developed tools to  <strong>prioritize tasks with complex relationships</strong>. 
												Ownership of these tools were handed off to the software team where they were made more robust and are 
												still in use today. </p>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/T206HDthin.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Product Support Specialist</h3>
											<p>What doesn't a Product Support Specialist do? Maybe the most fun job of my career. Anywhere from finding ways to automate 
												aircraft spec sheets, managing product improvements with outside vendors, to pulling out all stops to make sure deliveries 
												happen on time. I even would help customers determine if their bike would fit in one of our smaller airplanes. It was a small team 
												with very low priority, but the work was just as important as the higher priority tasks.</p>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/vssunitythin.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Deputy Program Manager</h3>
											<p>After spending 7 years in aviation, I joined The Spaceship Company which is the company that designed and manufactured the spaceships for Virgin
												Galactic. I was brought on board to be part of the two person team that would establish the Customer Support organization. Nothing like starting with 
												a blank slate and getting to build an organization into something of value. As products transfered ownership from one business to the other there was no shortage
												of obstacles to address. Anywhere from having to build up better relationships with the team, to setting them up for success with the tools they would need to
												do regular maintenance. This was all uncharted territory for the company.
