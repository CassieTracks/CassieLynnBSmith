											<h3>Relationship Building</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I love working side by side with my dog in our hybrid environment, but it also makes relationships with coworkers more challenging and more important than ever.
											Getting to know people, understanding their perspectives, and what is important to them is one of my best strengths. 
											Afterall, we are all working toward the same goal.

											<h3>Dealing with Ambiguity </h3>
										</header>
										<p>This might be my best strength. Is the guidance unclear, vague, and contradictory? Maybe even impossible? I 
											am the person for the job. I love diving into these scenarios, determining the core requirements, and communicating clear guidance as a result.
											This is also why I quickly become a go-to person on processes and software.

											<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
										</header>
										<p> This comes after figuring out the ambiguity. Once you know what is needed, you often are faced with the "how". This might be working through a 
											technical issue with subject matter experts, resolving personel issues, or conflicts between teams with different goals. No matter what the problem is
											I am always happy to dive in to help with the solution.

                                    <h3>Where am I Going?</h3>
                                    <p> When you look through my experience you will see a lot of aircrafts. I have enjoyed my time in the aerospace industry, but the products I support 
									are not products that everyday people, like myself, can interact with. Human Factors is one of my favorite parts of engineering and software design. Evaluating 
									various designs for how intuitive they are for human interaction is hard to do if you rarely or never use the end product. This is why I want to move into a 
									career managing projects I can interact with. The satisfaction I get out of creating an Excel macro, or an android app is something I have yet to experience 
									in my career. It is time for that to change. I believe this is a skill that we can use not only to design products and software, but also to better manage. 
									Even something as simple as an Excel spreadsheet can benefit from a simple elegant design that does only what is needed, and is intuitive enough to not need explanation. 
									This is something I consider regularly in my style of managing. Having well thought out tools, meetings, and requests reduces redundancy and increases consistency. I would 
									like more opportunity to do this in my career. I am also seeking opportunities to further my education in Human Computer Interactions and Material Design.

												<h2>Career Highlights</h2>
											</header>
											<a  class="image featured"><img src="images/citationlatitudethin.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Engineering Project Coordination</h3>
											<p>Coordinated engineering activities to get FAA certification as efficiently as possible. 
												In this role, I identified needs and developed tools to  <strong>prioritize tasks with complex relationships</strong>. 
												Ownership of these tools were handed off to the software team where they were made more robust and are 
												still in use today. This is one of many examples of ways I found to better manage and coordinate activities on a large team. </p>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/T206HDthin.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Product Support Specialist</h3>
											<p>What doesn't a Product Support Specialist do? Maybe the most fun job of my career. Anywhere from finding ways to automate 
												aircraft spec sheets, managing product improvements with outside vendors, to pulling out all stops to make sure deliveries 
												happen on time. I even would help customers determine if their bike would fit in one of our smaller airplanes. It was a small team 
												with very low priority, but the work was just as important as the higher priority tasks. Just meant we had to be more creative with the 
												resources we did have.</p>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/vssunitythin.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Deputy Program Manager</h3>
											<p>After spending 7 years in aviation, I joined The Spaceship Company which is the company that designed and manufactured the spaceships for Virgin
												Galactic. I was part of the two person team that established the Customer Support organization. Nothing like starting with 
												a blank slate and getting to build an organization into something of value. As products transfered ownership from one business to the other there was no shortage
												of obstacles to address. Anywhere from having to build up better relationships between companies, to setting them up for success with the tools they needed to
												do regular maintenance. This was uncharted territory for the company.
											</p>

											<h3>Senior Project Manager to Technical Manager</h3>
                                            <p>In 2019 I joined the Kansas City National Security Campus managed by Honeywell. I received a Q level security clearance, and managed multiple projects supporting the 
                                                test equipment needs for many of the products we made. These projects are managed using Earned Value Management methodology and I learned a lot about proper project management 
												as a result. I worked on a team of over 20 technical project managers until I was given the opportunity to manage the team. My team manages over
												400 different projects, and acts as the liasons between the Program Management Office and Engineering 
                                                as well as managing the scope, schedule, and cost for each project.

																<h3><a href="#">Android Development</a></h3>

															<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/androiddev.JPG" alt="" /></a>
															<p> In my free time, I have made several amateur apps through courses, my favorite being a kids drawing app and an initiative tracker to use during a D&D 
																campaign. In addition to learning a programming language, I have also had to adapt to other challenges. In aerospace things rarely change, where software 
																and programming languages seem to be ever changing and improving. It is much more of a continuous education where I have to stay up to date on changes as well.
																Since I love Human Factors and Human Computer Interaction philosophies, I gain even more appreciation when trying to figure out how to show intuitively when a 
																digital button is selected or not. It is certainly a challenge to create an app that looks nice and does not require an explanation on how to use it.
                                                             </p>

																<h3><a href="#">Excel Programming</a></h3>
															</header>
															<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/excel.JPG" alt="" /></a>
															<p>My experience with programming started with debugging VBA macros. This quickly turned into finding ways to automate 
                                                                as much of my job as I could. I learned how to tap into different databases throughout the company to pull delivery dates, the 
                                                                company phonebook for automated org charts, even generating automated aircraft spec sheets for our sales team to use. I often shared and created code 
																for others on the team to use. This taught me a lot about the challenges in programming for people. No one uses Excel like I do, and I learned 
																quickly that my codes were not robust enough to handle these differences. I had to learn ways to prevent actions, create ways to verify the code worked correctly, 
																and code in error handling. I even had to learn to program more efficiently when the macros became large enough to take a significant amount of time. 
                                                             </p>
